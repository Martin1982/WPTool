WPTool
======

A tool to manage wordpress

THIS TOOL IS NOT STABLE YET IN ANY WAY!

Requirements:
* Apache webserver
* Zend Framework 1.11
* One or more worpress blogs you have access to

Roadmap:
* ~~Setup an application~~
* ~~Open or create a database connection~~
* ~~Create user login~~
* ~~CRUD Wordpress site accesses~~
* Connect to Wordpress sites
* List connected sites with their status
* Show if there are updates available and link to the updates

This roadmap is still an approach to a very simple application. 
Future plans can be added at a later stage or added to the issues on github.
